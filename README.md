> Notes: `up` is now in Alpha! üéâ [(Changelog)](Changelog.md)\

**`up`** is a command line application that creates nginx server blocks quickly with a single command.


## Installation

`up` currently supports nginx mainline and nginx stable on Linux based distros. Support for more distros will come soon. Add an issue to bump this process. 

You will need to have [_node JS_](https://nodejs.org) and [_nginx_](https://nginx.org) installed.

Install `up` from npm:

`npm i -g up-serve`

> `up` is now available as a command.

## Basic Commands

Format: `up command <required> [optional]`

- `up static <domain> [outbound port]` - Create new static server at current folder.
- `up proxy <domain> <inbound port> [outbound port]` - Create new proxy server listening at said port.
- `up list` - List currently available servers.
- `up kill <domain>` - Kill the server for this domain.

## Examples

- `up static example.com` will serve a static website from current folder.
- `up proxy example.com 8081` will create a reverse proxy listening at port 8081.
- `up kill example.com`
