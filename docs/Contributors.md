# Contributors, Collaborators, and Guides

I'd like to thank and give credit to [The Devs Community](https://thedevs.network), who are the primary reason this exists.

Plenty of people gave their time guiding me and shaping this tool. I'd personally thank the following amazing people for their valuable support and feedback:

- Pouria Ezzati (https://github.com/poeti8)
- Thomas Rory Gummerson (https://github.com/trgwii)
- Omar Khalil (https://github.com/DonMcCoy)
- Martin (https://gitlab.com/C0rn3j)
- GingerPlusPlus (https://github.com/GingerPlusPlus)
- Faizan Akram (https://github.com/faizanakram99)
- Chris Watson (https://github.com/watzon)

And many many people who did not directly contribute but managed to keep listening to my crazy ideas (and motivating) towards the beginning of this project.
